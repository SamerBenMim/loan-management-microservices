<!-- ABOUT THE APPLICATION -->
##  ðŸ”­ About The Project

This module automates the loan process for a banking application, including initial borrower eligibility assessment and risk analysis. The system notifies the client if their application has been approved and generates loan agreements and amortization tables for the client to view and download. The system also uses OCR capabilities to extract information from uploaded documents.

<h2> <img src="https://github.com/Harpia-Vieillot/Harpia-Vieillot/blob/main/resources/codes.webp" width="50px">  Microservices </h2>

The loan management module is built using a microservice architecture based on the master-worker model. The master service is the Process Service, which orchestrates the workflow of the following services:

Commercial Service: Processes the loan application to check the eligibility of the borrower and the repayment terms and period, based on the borrowerâ€™s income and financial situation. This service establishes an initial scoring to assess the eligibility of the client to get the loan.

Risk Management Service: Analyzes the loan application to determine whether the borrower can afford the loan and whether there are any outstanding commitments with other banks. The service provides a final score that determines whether the loan application should be approved.

Credit Service: Establishes the final step by elaborating the credit agreement to be signed and the amortization table. Both documents can be later viewed/downloaded by the client.

The module uses a local database file and the services run on different ports.
